# PRI-01.3 - Dissemination of Data Privacy Program Information
Mechanisms exist to: 
 - Ensure that the public has access to information about organizational data privacy activities and can communicate with its Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or similar role;
 - Ensure that organizational data privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or otherwise; and
 - Utilize publicly facing email addresses and/or phone lines to enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct questions to data privacy office(s) regarding data privacy practices.
## Control questions
Does the organization: 
 - Ensure that the public has access to information about organizational data privacy activities and can communicate with its Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or similar role;
 - Ensure that organizational data privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or otherwise; and
 - Utilize publicly facing email addresses and/or phone lines to enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct questions to data privacy office(s) regarding data privacy practices?
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to:
 - Ensure that the public has access to information about organizational data privacy activities and can communicate with its Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or similar role;
 - Ensure that organizational data privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or otherwise; and
 - Utilize publicly facing email addresses and/ or phone lines to enable the public to provide feedback and/ or direct questions to data privacy offices regarding data privacy practices.
### Performed internally
Privacy (PRI) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	No formal data privacy team exists. Privacy roles are assigned to existing IT / cybersecurity.
•	Formal roles and responsibilities for data privacy may exist.
•	No formal data privacy principles are identified for the organization.
•	An ad hoc approach to Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) exists. 
•	Compliance efforts are not tied into an enterprise-wide cybersecurity and/ or data privacy program.
### Planned and tracked
Privacy (PRI) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Privacy management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices. 
•	The data privacy program is developed to work with IT and cybersecurity staff to ensure that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations for Personal Data (PD) are properly identified and implemented across the enterprise.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for data privacy management.
•	A qualified individual is formally assigned as the Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, to lead the organization’s data privacy program. This individual may be assigned to multiple duties, including that as a Data Protection Officer (DPO).
•	The CPO, or similar role, identifies “data privacy principles” that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to, based on leading data privacy practices. 
### Well defined
Privacy (PRI) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A Privacy program, run by a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, ensures that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations are properly identified and implemented to limit and secure Personal Data (PD) that the organization stores, transmits and processes.
•	A data privacy team oversees the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. 
•	Data Protection Officers (DPOs) are assigned to work closely with business units and project teams to ensure data privacy principles are being implemented.
•	CPO and DPO determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance and sharing of PD, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need.
•	As part of the organization’s data privacy program, the CPO publishes a clear set of “data privacy principles”, based on leading data privacy practices, that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to. 
•	A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, ensures both cybersecurity & data privacy principles are identified and implemented within ongoing or planned projects.
### Quantitatively controllled
Privacy (PRI) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.
### Continuously improving
Privacy (PRI) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.
- 	Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.
