# GOV-04 - Assigned Cybersecurity & Data Protection Responsibilities
Mechanisms exist to assign one or more qualified individuals with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data protection program. 
## Control questions
Does the organization assign one or more qualified individuals with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data protection program? 
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to assign a qualified individual with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data privacy program. 
### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to assign a qualified individual with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data privacy program. 
### Planned and tracked
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Cybersecurity and data privacy governance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy governance activities.
•	The Chief Information Officer (CIO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function, based on business requirements.
•	A qualified individual is assigned the role and responsibilities to centrally manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain a cybersecurity & data privacy program (e.g., cybersecurity director or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)).
•	No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing cybersecurity personnel.
•	Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented.
•	Cybersecurity policies and standards exist that are aligned with a leading cybersecurity framework (e.g., SCF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27002 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework).
•	Controls are assigned to sensitive/regulated assets to comply with specific compliance requirements.
•	Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations, but are not standardized across the organization. 
•	Documentation is made available to internal personnel.
### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
•	Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. 
•	Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. 
•	Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
•	Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
•	Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
### Quantitatively controllled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to assign a qualified individual with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data privacy program. 
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to assign a qualified individual with the mission and resources to centrally-manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain an enterprise-wide cybersecurity & data privacy program.
