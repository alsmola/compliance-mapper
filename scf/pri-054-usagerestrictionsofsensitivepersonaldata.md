# PRI-05.4 - Usage Restrictions of Sensitive Personal Data
Mechanisms exist to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices. 
## Control questions
Does the organization restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices? 
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices. 
### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices. 
### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices. 
### Well defined
Privacy (PRI) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A Privacy program, run by a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, ensures that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations are properly identified and implemented to limit and secure Personal Data (PD) that the organization stores, transmits and processes.
•	A data privacy team oversees the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. 
•	Data Protection Officers (DPOs) are assigned to work closely with business units and project teams to ensure data privacy principles are being implemented.
•	CPO and DPO determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance and sharing of PD, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need.
•	As part of the organization’s data privacy program, the CPO publishes a clear set of “data privacy principles”, based on leading data privacy practices, that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to. 
•	A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, ensures both cybersecurity & data privacy principles are identified and implemented within ongoing or planned projects.
### Quantitatively controllled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices. 
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to restrict the use of Personal Data (PD) to only the authorized purpose(s) consistent with applicable laws, regulations and in data privacy notices.
