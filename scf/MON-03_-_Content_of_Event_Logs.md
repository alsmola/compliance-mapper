# MON-03 - Content of Event Logs
Mechanisms exist to configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum:
 - Establish what type of event occurred;
 - When (date and time) the event occurred;
 - Where the event occurred;
 - The source of the event;
 - The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and 
 - The identity of any user/subject associated with the event.
