## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the identification and implementation of relevant statutory, regulatory and contractual controls?

CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the organization to manage compliance efforts.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program with regards to GRC operations.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure compliance requirements are identified and documented.<br>- The GRC function, or similar function:<br>o	Ensures data/process owners understand their requirements to manage applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls through oversight and written guidance. <br>o	Provides applicable stakeholders with status reports on control execution to enable security controls oversight.<br>o	Works with data/process owners and asset custodians to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations are met.<br>o	Conducts cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, on a regular cadence that is defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy controls are centrally managed through a technology solution (e.g., GRC solution) to assign controls, track control activities and report on compliance efforts.<br>- Legal representation is consulted on an as-needed basis. |
