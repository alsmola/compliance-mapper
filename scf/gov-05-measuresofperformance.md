# GOV-05 - Measures of Performance
Mechanisms exist to develop, report and monitor cybersecurity & data privacy program measures of performance.
## Control questions
Does the organization develop, report and monitor cybersecurity & data privacy program measures of performance?
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to develop, report and monitor cybersecurity & data privacy program measures of performance.
### Performed internally
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	No formal cybersecurity and/ or data privacy principles are identified for the organization.
•	No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.
•	Governance efforts are narrowly-limited to certain compliance requirements.
•	Formal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and/ or data privacy may exist.
•	Cybersecurity and data privacy governance is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.
•	Basic cybersecurity policies and standards are documented [not based on any industry framework]
•	Basic procedures are established for important tasks, but are ad hoc and not formally documented.
•	Documentation is made available to internal personnel.
•	Organizational leadership maintains an informal process to review and respond to observed trends.
### Planned and tracked
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Cybersecurity and data privacy governance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy governance activities.
•	The Chief Information Officer (CIO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function, based on business requirements.
•	A qualified individual is assigned the role and responsibilities to centrally manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain a cybersecurity & data privacy program (e.g., cybersecurity director or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)).
•	No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing cybersecurity personnel.
•	Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented.
•	Cybersecurity policies and standards exist that are aligned with a leading cybersecurity framework (e.g., SCF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27002 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework).
•	Controls are assigned to sensitive/regulated assets to comply with specific compliance requirements.
•	Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations, but are not standardized across the organization. 
•	Documentation is made available to internal personnel.
•	Simple metrics exist to provide operational oversight of a limited scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls.
### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
•	Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. 
•	Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. 
•	Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
•	Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
•	Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
•	Metrics are developed that provide management oversight to ensure processes continue to operate as designed and within define parameters.
•	Quarterly Business Review (QBR), or similar status reporting, exists to provide recurring reports on the state of the cybersecurity & data privacy program to the organization's Board of Directors.
•	Comprehensive metrics exist to provide oversight of organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls.
### Quantitatively controllled
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Metrics are developed that provide management insight, per a quantitative understanding of process capabilities, to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.
### Continuously improving
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.
- 	Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.
