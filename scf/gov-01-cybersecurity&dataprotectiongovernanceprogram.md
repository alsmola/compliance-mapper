# GOV-01 - Cybersecurity & Data Protection Governance Program
Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation of cybersecurity & data protection governance controls.
## Mapped framework controls
### SOC 2
- [CC1.2](../soc2/cc12.md)
### GDPR
- [Art 32.1](../gdpr/art321.md)
- [Art 32.2](../gdpr/art322.md)
